  <h2>Why HVAC Repairs Matter in Garland</h2>
  <p>Garland residents know that the weather can be unpredictable. One day it’s hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk, and the next, a cold front can sneak in.

  <p>Common HVAC issues include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strange noises from the unit</li>
    <li>Uneven heating or cooling</li>
    <li>High energy bills</li>
    <li>Leaking refrigerant</li>
    <li>Thermostat malfunctions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Ignoring these problems can lead to more expensive repairs down the line or even complete system failure. That’s why timely HVAC repairs in Garland are not just recommended — they’re essential.</p>
